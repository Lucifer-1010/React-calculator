# React-calculator
## Introduction
React is well known for handling forms and updating DOM smoothly. Both these capabilities provide a great opportunity for developers to practice their React skills by building a simple form calculator.In this program, you'll learn how to build a basic form calculator without any external libraries by merely utilizing the core concepts of React, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.

Make sure you have Nodejs and npm installed in your machine (at least version 8 or higher) along with a code editor and a web browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox).
reate a new project using create-react-app: 
```
npx create-react-app react-form-calculator
```
Replace the files and then run

## Testing

Inside the root directory, run:
```
npm run start
```
## Improvising the App

There are many ways you can explore beyond this guide and make some improvisations to the app.

## Updating the UI

You can use any CSS framework to give this form a more intriguing design and interface. You can take direct inspiration from the calculator app on your phone and try making an exact replica of it through some custom styling.

## Extending the Features

Similar to the way addition was performed, you can extend this app to perform other basic mathematical calculations, such as subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. For incorporating more advanced features, JavaScript's Math object provides a plethora of math functions that you can use right out of the box.

## Setting Validations and Alerts

A great user experience is always accompanied by some meaningful feedback to the user. You can set validations wherever necessary and add alerts to let users know about current processes, errors, or events when the app is in play.

## Using a Keypad Component

To make it look like an actual calculator, you can use a keypad component instead of an input field. This can be a separate component rendered as a child in App.js. It also eliminates the need to set validation on the input field for entering anything other than an integer.

## Converting to a Progressive Web App

React provides convenient ways to convert any single page app into a progressive web app to give a more native feel to the user. You can try converting it into a progressive web app so it lands on mobile devices as a pseudo native app and not the traditional web app.

## Breaking Down into Components

You can redefine the architecture of your app by breaking it down into reusable components. For instance, you can create a separate component for handling the result, one for the keypad, and further inside the keypad a separate component for buttons.

## Conclusion

Forms, when made into controlled components, can be used in a number of ways. As a developer, you should be able to code regular JavaScript easily in React to simplify development patterns and interact with the DOM conveniently. In this guide, you learned how to use a basic form in React as a calculator and how to extend and improve it so you can eventually add it to your dev portfolio!
